Treasure Goblin is a tool that manages passwords and (optionally)
crypto-coin keys.

It hashes a master password using very strong crypto, combining
three good password hashing functions: PBKDF2, scrypt and argon2.
The last one can be configured to use an arbitrary amount of RAM,
which makes bruteforce attacks very hard.

I recommend using Diceware Passphrase to generate your master password,
and you can use e.g. your email as salt.

You can try it out using my live CD, at https://github.com/goblin/gblcclcd

To derive a key from your master password, after running treasure_goblin,
type:

  h keyname

You can chain multiple keys with a slash, e.g.

  h keyname/0/1

This allows you to group keys and give access to a subtree easily.
For instance, you can run `treasure_goblin --master-entropy=$DATA`,
where $DATA is the result of `h keyname`, and you'll be able to
get the `keyname/0/1` with `h 0/1` there.

The `.` (single dot) key is special - it uses master entropy directly.
If someone gets this key this is pretty much equivalent to them
knowing your master password, as they will be able to derive
everything from it (by just passing it as --master-entropy).

If built with libbitcoin, it will be able to generate BIP32 HD
keys from entropy material, as well as seeds and keys that Electrum
can use.

TECHNICAL INFO

Salt is hashed once with Blake2. The resulting binary data is
then fed as salt to PBKDF2, scrypt and argon2. The output of those
functions is XORed together to produce the master entropy.

User keys are derived from master entropy using keyed Blake2, where
the user key is passed as data, while master entropy (or parent
key's entropy) is passed as the Blake2 key. The result is then
once again hashed with Blake2, this time with no key.

Electrum seeds are created the same way as my electrumize-seed
script from https://github.com/goblin/electrum-scripts .
You can then use e1st to get the first address used by Electrum,
or expub to get the master public address it uses.

DISCLAIMER

This is early-stage development version and should be considered
highly unstable. I'm not taking any responsibility for any losses
related to the use of this software.
